    <p>
      This text is one step up the scale from body size. An interview with
      current Senior Product Designer, Elaine O'Neill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The developer interviewed one of Travelport’s Atlas design team members, a
      senior product designer, Elaine O’Neill. The developer conducted this
      interview to gather more information about the Atlas Design System from a
      designer who has been with Travelport since the early stages of Atlas. The
      developer will summarise the information collected from the interview
      below. The documents of this interview can be found in Appendix C.
    </p>
    <h2>Getting Started in Atlas</h2>
    <p>
      Elaine, now senior product designer for the Atlas design system team,
      first joined the team after completing a master's degree in 2019 and
      started as an associate product designer for Atlas. She mentioned that
      this role was her first job in product design and stated that it was a
      learning curve. She explained the motivation behind implementing a design
      system for Travelport. The company has a variety of applications,
      websites, and products that previously did not look and feel like the
      Travelport brand. Travelport's designers created components and patterns
      individually, leading to inconsistency, time-wasting, and more effort
      needed in development and prototyping. Since Atlas, there has been
      improved consistency throughout the organisation's products.
    </p>
    <h2>The Benefits of a Design System</h2>
    <p>
      Elaine then listed the many benefits of other teams in Travelport using
      the Atlas design system. One key advantage was on the design end; the
      designers can focus more on innovation, research, and user experience.
      They understand that by using Atlas, their components are consistent
      across all products. By following guidelines on the components, patterns,
      and more, the designers can produce designs that lead from the latest best
      practices in UX/UI design. She then explained more critical benefits for
      the developers, the company, and branding.
    </p>
    <h2>The Challenges of a Design System</h2>
    <p>
      When asked if Elaine faced any challenges throughout being a designer on
      the Atlas design team, Elaine explained how communication and
      collaboration outside of the core team is a constant challenge. It is
      challenging to receive feedback, requirements, and input from other
      designers outside of the core team, but she stated that it is a necessary
      task to complete. Another challenge she mentioned was it is difficult for
      some products to adopt the Atlas design system. This challenge is due to
      these products having complex user interfaces and technology debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, Elaine was asked about designers outside Atlas that she would
      recommend. She mentioned two designers, Brad Frost and Nathan Curtis, who
      she references a lot regarding best practices in design systems. Brad
      Frost is the author of Atomic Design, which discusses designing systems of
      components. She also said a few more designers and podcasts about the
      challenges designers face in design systems.
